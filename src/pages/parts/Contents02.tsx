        nucleus (developmentally old nucleus group), the Meinert nucleus, the
        dorsal of the diagonal circumflex nucleus and the brainstem region. NFTs
        are also found in monoaminenuclei such as the ventral tegmental nucleus,
        locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei (upper central nucleus). These nuclei
        are also the predominant nuclei of NFT in ATD. In particular, the
        Meinert nucleus is a nerve nucleus associated with the nootropic drug
        acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, but the frequency of appearance of NFT
        is about 10 to 20% in the early stage of ATD, and 60% or more in the
        advanced stage.
