NFTs are also found in monoaminenuclei such as the ventral tegmental nucleus, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei (upper central nucleus). These nuclei are also the predominant nuclei of NFT in ATD. In particular, the Meinert nucleus is a nerve nucleus associated with the nootropic drug acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, but the frequency of appearance of NFT is about 10 to 20% in the early stage of ATD, and 60% or more in the advanced stage.</div>
